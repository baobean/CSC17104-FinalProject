    "The original data is collected from a random sample of adults (one per household) through a telephone survey across over 400,000 U.S. citizens regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services in the year of 2015. The cleaned data is processed by selecting features related to diabetes disease and other chronic health conditions only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group has an interest in medical and healthcare-related datasets, therefore we chose this dataset to process. The dataset has the potential to provide insights about what and how factors contribute to the form of chronic health conditions."
